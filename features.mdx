## Document Organization and Folders

You organize documentation using nested folders and intuitive hierarchies. Create folders to group related pages, making navigation seamless.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Folder" icon="folder-plus">
    Navigate to your workspace root. Click the `+` button and select `New Folder`. Name it `guides`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Pages" icon="file-plus">
    Inside the folder, add MDX pages. Drag and drop to reorder.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Nest Folders" icon="folder">
    Right-click a folder to create subfolders like `guides/quickstart`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

This structure supports unlimited nesting without performance issues.

## Version Control for Docs

Shxian Qiu integrates version control directly into your docs. You commit changes, view history, and revert as needed, similar to Git workflows.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Commit Changes" icon="git-commit">
    Edit a page and click `Commit`. Add a message like `Update quickstart guide`.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="View History" icon="history">
    Select a page, go to `History` tab. Compare diffs between versions.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Revert" icon="undo">
    Choose a version and select `Revert`. Confirm to restore.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Expandable title="Advanced Branching" default-open="false">

  ```javascript
  // Search API example
  const results = await fetch('https://api.example.com/docs/search?q=authentication&filter=folder:guides');
  const data = await results.json();
  console.log(data.hits); // Array of matching docs
  ```
  ```python
  import requests
  response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/docs/search', params={
    'q': 'authentication',
    'filter': 'folder:guides'
  })
  print(response.json()['hits'])
  ```
</CodeGroup>
